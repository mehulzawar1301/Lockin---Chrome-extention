## What it does

LockIn lets you set daily time limits on websites. When you hit your limit, the site gets blocked with a full-screen lock overlay. You can unlock temporarily using a quick extension (+10 mins, 2x per day) or with your PIN for a custom amount of time (5–15 mins), after which a 1-hour cooldown kicks in.

Everything is PIN-protected — the dashboard, settings, and the extension itself.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Install and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mehulzawar1301/Lockin---Chrome-extention.git
cd Lockin---Chrome-extention/lockin-extension
npm install
npm run build
```

This generates the `dist/` folder.

### Load in Chrome

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right toggle)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `dist/` folder

### Development (watch mode)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Rebuilds automatically on file changes. Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions` after each rebuild.

## How it works

### Time tracking

The background service worker uses `chrome.alarms` to fire every 10 seconds (MV3 compatible — `setInterval` doesn't survive service worker restarts). Each tick queries the live active tab via `chrome.tabs.query` and increments usage for that domain in `chrome.storage.local`.

### Blocking

The content script polls `GET_STATUS` every 10 seconds. When a site is over its limit, it renders a full-screen lock overlay directly in the page DOM. The overlay handles the PIN flow, extension buttons, and cooldown timer entirely in the page context.

### PIN security

PINs are hashed with SHA-256 (Web Crypto API) with a fixed salt before storing in `chrome.storage.local`. The raw PIN is never stored.

### Daily reset

A `chrome.alarms` alarm fires at midnight (local time) and clears that day's usage data.
